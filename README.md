# Floor Monitor Scheduler

A simple, user-friendly Python desktop application to randomly assign people as floor monitors over multiple days and floors — perfect for dorms, offices, hostels, student residences, camps, or any multi-floor shared living/working space.

## Features

- **Random assignments**
- **Fair rotation when reuse is needed**
- Supports **txt**, **csv**, or **xlsx** name lists (one name per line / first column)
- Handles cases with **not enough unique names** by asking whether to allow reuse
- Clean tabular output (Floors as rows, Days as columns)
